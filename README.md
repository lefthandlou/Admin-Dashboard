# Admin-Dashboard

Admin Dashboard Project - The Odin Project

Struggled with what icons to use for this project, but ultimately settled for SVG icons due to a number of articles saying icon fonts are bad for accessibility. Icon fonts are treated like text, making them difficult for screen readers to properly interpret; assistive fonts may replace or remove icon fonts entirely, making a webiste potentially unusable; and the icons cannot be labeled or described directly and may not have any direct surrounding context. SVGs, on the other hand, are images, can include metadata for screen readers and other accessible features, are easier to maintain as a library, and play more nicely with CSS than fonts.
